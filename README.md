# README Generator
  
## User Story

As a developer, I want to create a README generator so that I can quickly make professional looking README's.


## Acceptance Criteria

This application has to be on the command line and be able to ask for information that's required for READMEs.
A professional README.md is generated with a project title along with a table of contents. This table of contents should include the installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions relating to the README for the project. 
The application is also required to ask for the GitHub username and the user's email to attach to the README
When done filling out all the questions, the application should create the file contenting the README along with all the information the user has given.


## Demo

Here's a demo of my application:
